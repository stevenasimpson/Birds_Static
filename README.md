## Description
This project houses the neccesary data and source files to form a complete webpage hosted on GitLab (Otago). 

The content of this webpage is a collection of New Zealand birds with various scientific data and images.

The data folder holds both the bird data (JSON format) and the bird images themselves (images folder).

## Navigation
By default, all birds are displayed in alphabetical order based on their common name.

The 'Filter Birds' section allows the user to input a search query, as well as to filter by the conservation status and by an ordering method. 

Note: whilst the search bar does not require a query to filter the birds, the filtering and ordering selectors must be selected to filter.

The Conservation Status key on the left pane displays the meaning of the coloured diamonds on each bird's information card.

## Enlarging Function
This webpage includes a function to enlarge the information or the image of a bird based on where the mouse is pointed.

Simply hover over the bird information or image to enlarge the selected item.
